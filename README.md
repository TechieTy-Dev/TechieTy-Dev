- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechieTy-Dev
- 👀 I’m interested in Automation, Crypto, APIs, & love learning from those who are more experienced than myself. Always open to feedback :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything JS for building out apps. I'm looking to improve my Python skills as well. My goal is to create my own SaaS in the future! I could use tips on clean and refactoring my code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on APIs, Bots, Blockchain related projects, and would love to help anyone with their software. 
- 📫 How to reach me
