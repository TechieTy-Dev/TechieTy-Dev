- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechieTy-Dev
- 👀 I’m interested in Artifical Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Web Apps. I love learning from those who are more experienced than myself. Always open to feedback :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything JS by building web app clones. I'm looking to improve my Python skills as well by learning AI and Blockchain projects. My goal is to create my own SaaS in the future! I could use tips on clean and refactoring my code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI and Blockchain related projects, and would love to help anyone with their software. 
- 📫 How to reach me
